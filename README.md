# Sticky Notes Frontend

Sticky Notes is a note app with the functions of creating, editing, archiving, and deleting notes. In addition, it allows you to assign a color to the notes allowing categorize and filter them, including the ability to search both by title and body of the note. Finally, the application has internationalization (English and Spanish) and a basic JWT-based authentication system.

This repository contains the third frontend version of Sticky Notes, developed with Typescript and Vue, using Tailwind CSS for the styles and Pinia and Tanstack Query for the state. I decided to build this version with Vue because I wanted to practice with this framework.
